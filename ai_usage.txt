For this assignment we utilized AI to helo guide throguh unknown errors and ambigous errors to direct us towards
the root of the problem. In the beginning when setting up mongodb, it was difficult to understand what the errors were being
thrown at us for. Another useful way was for syntax. In one instance we were trying to set have a variable be an array of  the Comment interface
I was having trouble setting assigning that info after the comments were retrieved from the database, but but it gave me a short hand
method by just setting comments = {the returned json data}. We primarily used claude and chat gpt for this assigning.
